# Online-Medical-Shop

Project is Online Medical Shopping , where I am creating a website where users can buy medicines. Nearly everything we need these days is available at our fingertips. The newest members of this convenience club are online pharmacies. When patients and family members are already stressed about an illness, going to buy medicines can become an added burden â€“ one that online pharmacies have wiped off.The process of buying medicines online comes with numerous perks in terms of savings. When we purchase products via online pharmacies, we can avail varied discounts, bank offers, cash back and much more. Additionally, the medicines that are not available offline can be easily found at these online pharmacies. Like all the popular online pharmacies our website has functionalities where users can Sign-up/Login and we remember their login info. , then the user can view different products in different categories. We have created different categories to provide so users may find it easy to search for the required Medicine or Supplements. We have used Database tables , to store information about user and Product Details and we have also used SESSIONS to store info in variables. Here are the code files and its contents.
